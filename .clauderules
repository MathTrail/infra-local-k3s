# Identity & Context
You are working on mathtrail-infra-local-k3s — the K3d cluster setup for local MathTrail development.
This repo creates a K3d cluster (K3s in Docker) with registry, kubeconfig, and port forwarding.
It must be set up FIRST before any other MathTrail development.

Tech Stack: K3d, Just, Docker
Registry: k3d-mathtrail-registry.localhost:5050

# Communication Map
No application communication — provides the Kubernetes cluster.
All MathTrail repos depend on this cluster being running.
Kubeconfig: ~/.kube/k3d-mathtrail-dev.yaml

# Development Standards
- K3d cluster config: 1 server, 2 agent nodes
- Registry must be accessible at k3d-mathtrail-registry.localhost:5050
- Kubeconfig must be saved to ~/.kube/ for DevContainer mounting
- Port forwarding for common services must be preconfigured

# Commit Convention
Use Conventional Commits: feat(k3s):, fix(k3s):, chore(k3s):
Example: fix(k3s): update port mapping for oathkeeper

# Testing Strategy
Create: `just create`
Verify: `just status`, `kubectl get nodes`
Registry: `docker pull k3d-mathtrail-registry.localhost:5050/test` (should connect)
Priority: Manual cluster verification
